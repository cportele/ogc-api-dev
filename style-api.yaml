    Open Portrayal Framework Style API (DRAFT)
  description: |-
    # Overview
    
    This is a draft of the OGC Testbed-15 Style API in the Open 
    Portrayal Framework task. The Style API is a Web API for 
    fetching and managing styles. 
    
    The main consumers of this API in Testbed-15 are the 
    following components.

    * **Visual style editors** create, update and delete styles 
    for datasets that are shared by other Web APIs implementing 
    OGC API Features, OGC API Coverages or OGC API Tiles;
    * **Web APIs implementing OGC API Maps** fetch styles and 
    render spatial data (features or coverages) on the server;
    * **Map clients** fetch styles and render spatial data 
    (features or coverages) on the client.

    Feature data is either accessed directly or organised in 
    spatial partitions ("vector tiles").

    This API uses the following style-related terms and concepts.
    
    * **Styles** organize a sequence of rules of symbolizing 
    instructions to be applied by a rendering engine on one 
    or more features and/or coverages.
    * **Style encodings** are specifications to express a style
    as one or more files. In Testbed-15 Mapbox Styles, OGC SLD
    versions 1.0 and 1.1 are used.
    * **Stylesheets** are representations of a style in a style 
    encoding.
    * **Style metadata** is essential information about a style
    in order to support users to discover and select styles for
    rendering their data and for visual style editors to create
    user interfaces for editing a style.
    
    Stylesheets often reference external resources, especially 
    symbols and fonts to be used in the rendering process.
    
    Symbols are either managed as a single file for each symbol
    or they are organised in a sprite - all symbols combined in
    a single bitmap image to reduce memory and the number of 
    http requests. Single symbols and sprites are supported
    by this API and they may be stored on this server, for example,
    to avoid issues with cross-origin requests. Of course,
    existing external symbol libraries may also be referenced 
    from stylesheets.
    
    This API does not support font resources and if you want to
    reference fonts / glyphs from a stylesheet, please reference
    an existing font library.
    
    Currently no media types have been registered for Mapbox 
    Styles or OGC SLD. Temporary media types in the vnd-branch
    are used for now.

    For more background information see [the Vector Tiles Pilot Extension 
    Engineering Report](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/per/18-101.html#StylesAPI).

    The API is consistent with the emerging OGC API family of 
    standards and could be a starting point for a future 
    "OGC API - Styles" standard. API components that are used
    by more than one of the draft API specifications are not
    defined in this document, but are defined in a 
    [domain for OGC API building blocks on Swaggerhub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/domains/cportele/ogc-api/1.0.0) 
    and are referenced.

    This document is also available in [GitHub](https://github.com/cportele/t15-opf/blob/master/style-api.yaml).
    
    # Conformance classes
    
    The Style API specifies the following conformance classes.
    
    * **'core'** supports the basic GET operations on `/`, `/conformance`, `/styles`, `/styles/{styleId}`, and `/styles/{styleId}/metadata`
    * **'json'** supports `application/json` as a response to the GET operations on `/`, `/conformance`, `/styles`, and `/styles/{styleId}/metadata`
    * **'html'** supports `text/html` as a response to the GET operations on `/`, `/conformance`, `/styles`, and `/styles/{styleId}/metadata`
    * **'manage-styles'** adds POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH methods on `/styles`, `/styles/{styleId}`, and `/styles/{styleId}/metadata`
    * **'style-validation'** adds the `validate` parameter on POST requests to `/styles`
    * **'resources'** adds the basic GET operations on `/resources`, and `/resources/{resourceId}`
    * **'manage-resources'** adds POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH methods on `/resources`, and `/resources/{resourceId}`
    * **'mapbox-styles'** supports Mapbox Styles as a style encoding on `/styles` and `/styles/{styleId}`
    * **'sld-10'** supports SLD 1.0 as a style encoding on `/styles` and `/styles/{styleId}`
    * **'sld-11'** supports SLD 1.1 as a style encoding on `/styles` and `/styles/{styleId}`
    
    # Examples how clients are expected to interact with the API
    
    **TODO: use working URIs once Testbed-15 implementations are 
    available.**
    
    Let's assume that a dataset with topographic data is avaiable 
    via an API that implements the OGC API Features and Tiles 
    specifications at `https://example.com/data/` (landing page
    for the data access API). 
    See [Here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/cportele/opf-features-api/1.0.0)
    is a template of the definition of that API.
    
    Roads are included in the data in the collection `transportationgroundcrv`.
    Roads are the features with a property `f_code` with a value of `AP030`.
    
    ## A visual style editor creating a new style
    
    **TODO**
    
    ## A visual style editor updating an existing style
    
    **TODO**
    
    ## A map client
    
    **TODO**

        Testbed-15 only requires support for a small number of the

        If the parameter `validate` is set to `yes`, the
        style will be validated before adding the style to
        the server. If the parameter `validate` is set to 
        `only`, the server will not be changed and only the
        validation result will be returned.
        
        In case, a new style is created, the following rules
        apply.
        
        If the style submitted in the request body includes an
        identifier (this depends on the style encoding), that 
        identifier will be used. If a style with that identifier 
        already exists, an error is returned.
        
        If no identifier can be determined from the submitted 
        style, the server will assign a new identifier to the 
        style.

        A minimal style metadata resource is created at 
        `/styles/{styleId}/metadata`. Please update the metadata 
        using a PUT request to keep the style metadata consistent 
        with the style definition.
        
        The URI of the new style is returned in the header 
        `Location`.
        
        This operation is only available to registered style 
        authors.

        The PATCH semantics in this operation are defined by 
        RFC 7396 (JSON Merge Patch). From the specification:
        
        _"A JSON merge patch document describes changes to be 
        made to a target JSON document using a syntax that 
        closely mimics the document being modified. Recipients
        of a merge patch document determine the exact set of 
        changes being requested by comparing the content of 
        the provided patch against the current content of the 
        target document. If the provided merge patch contains 
        members that do not appear within the target, those 
        members are added. If the target does contain the 
        member, the value is replaced. Null values in the 
        merge patch are given special meaning to indicate 
        the removal of existing values in the target."_
        
        Some examples:
        
        To add or update the point of contact, the access
        constraint and the revision date, just send
        
        ```
        {
          "pointOfContact": "Jane Doe"
          "accessConstraints": "restricted"
          "dates": {
            "revision": "2019-05-17T11:46:12Z"
          }
        }
        ```
        
        To remove the point of contact, the access 
        constraint and the revision date, send 

        ```
        {
          "pointOfContact": null
          "accessConstraints": null
          "dates": {
            "revision": null
          }
        }
        ```
        
        For arrays the complete array needs to be sent.
        To add a keyword to the example style metadata object, send

        ```
        {
          "keywords": [ "basemap", "TDS", "TDS 6.1", "OGC API", "new keyword" ]
        }
        ```
        
        To remove the "TDS" keyword, send
        
        ```
        {
          "keywords": [ "basemap", "TDS 6.1", "OGC API", "new keyword" ]
        }
        ```
        
        To remove the keywords, send
        
        ```
        {
          "keywords": null
        }
        ```
        
        The same applies to `stylesheets` and `layers`. To update 
        these members, you have to send the complete new array value.

        authors.

        three resources. Each of the resources needs to be created
